# Gear Inventory Page for Alfred Be Loud
## A site to view and track the gear used by the band
![band logo](public/images/alfredbgog.jpg)
## Introduction
This site is a more fun way to track all the gear we have in our band than an excel page!

## Deployed Site
[Gear Inventory Page]https://gear-inventory-app-6f540245740d.herokuapp.com
Currently, as a guest you can only look at the gear we have. I have created registered users that can do full CRUD on each item or new items.

## Project Planning
Most of the planning that went into this project was how best to combine the various applications we had made in class or during homework, and then some CSS updates to make things look on brand to the band.

## Future Goals
I want to create admin users that can use the full CRUD application and regular users who could in the future make inquiries about the gear, contact us, or purchase merchandise.
I also want to make it so that when an admin logs in they are dropped on a page that includes all the gear associated with their account.
